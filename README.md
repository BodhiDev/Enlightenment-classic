# Enlightenment-classic

This is the original Enlightenment/EFL theme saved for prosperities sake and for those who prefer the classic enlightenment look.

# Compatibility

This theme has been taken from EFL at the commit prior to the introduction of Raster's new flat theme, commit [d8023529a1d747e97babca90a1072be5cddecbb7 ](https://git.enlightenment.org/core/efl.git/commit/data/elementary/themes?id=d8023529a1d747e97babca90a1072be5cddecbb7). It is compatible with efl version 1.25 and enligtenment version 0.24.2. It should be backward compatible to some degree. The Bodhi Team makes no promise to keep this theme compatible with later versions of either enlightenment or EFL. If  time allows we will try, otherwise patches would be greatly appreciated.
